title: Reward system
AdGuard, a popular ad-blocking app, offers a reward system for users who actively participate in their program. The basic idea is that users who choose to participate in the reward program allow AdGuard to use their device's processing power to mine cryptocurrency, which is then used to fund various projects and initiatives. In exchange for allowing their device to be used for mining, users earn rewards in the form of AdGuard credits, which can be used to pay for premium features and subscriptions within the app.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of how the AdGuard reward system works:

Users can opt-in to the reward program by navigating to the "Rewards" section within the AdGuard app settings.

Once opted-in, AdGuard will use a small portion of the user's device processing power to mine cryptocurrency, specifically Monero (XMR), which is considered a privacy-focused digital currency.

The cryptocurrency that is mined is then used to fund various initiatives and projects, such as supporting open-source software development, improving internet privacy and security, and other related causes.

Users who participate in the reward program earn AdGuard credits, which are redeemable within the app for premium features and subscriptions. The amount of credits earned is based on the amount of processing power contributed by the user's device, and can vary depending on factors such as device specs and overall network conditions.

It's important to note that the AdGuard reward program is completely optional, and users can choose to opt-out at any time. Additionally, users who choose to participate should be aware that allowing their device to be used for mining will consume additional battery and processing power, which could potentially impact device performance. Overall, the AdGuard reward system offers an interesting way for users to support important causes while also gaining benefits within the app.
